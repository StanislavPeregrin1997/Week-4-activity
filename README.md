A lot of them do not require any university degree, instead lots of them require a specific skill that applicant has such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, SASS, Jquery or MySQL

Usually above £25K

•	What non-technical/personal or candidate skills/qualities are you expected to have?
To be very communicative and potential leader of the teams

•	What are the top five technical skills you are going to need?

Based on these questions I have found that lots of jobs these days do no require applicant to have university degrees to be able to get the jobs, they require to have lots of experience of using specific web development software’s with several years of experience
